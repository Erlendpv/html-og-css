                    <p>Resentment that turned into a deep depression
                        Found myself screaming in the hotel room
                        I didn't wanna self destruct
                        The evils of Lucy was all around me
                        So I went running for answers.</p>

                    <p>Until I came home
                        But that didn't stop survivor's guilt
                        Going back and forth trying to convince myself the stripes I earned
                        Or maybe how A-1 my foundation was
                        But while my loved ones was fighting the
                        Continuous war back in the city, I was entering a new one
                        A war that was based on apartheid and discrimination.</p>

            <p>Made me wanna go back to the city and tell the homies what I learned
                The word was respect
                Just because you wore a different gang color than mine's
                Doesn't mean I can't respect you as a black man
                Forgetting all the pain and hurt we caused each other in these streets
                If I respect you, we unify and stop the enemy from killing us
                But I don't know, I'm no mortal man, maybe I'm just another DUDE"</p>
